# A Survey on Identifying Digital Deception In Deepfakes Using OSINT Techniques
This work spearheads the research problem of identifying deepfakes by applying them mainly to MobileNetV2 and InceptionV3 models including a new hybrid model approach. Each of these models' findings has been evaluated and noted down.

# Significance of Deepfakes​
- The increasing realism of deepfakes makes it difficult to distinguish between authentic and manipulated content, posing significant challenges for detection and verification.​
- Deepfakes can manipulate public opinion by creating convincing yet false representations of political figures, potentially influencing elections and political and economic stability.​
- They can be used to create misleading content that spreads misinformation, affecting social trust and causing harm to individuals and communities.​
- This sophistication can erode public trust in digital media and increase the complexity of mitigating the associated risks.​

# OSINT Overview​
- OSINT plays a critical role in identifying and mitigating digital deception, such as fake news, misinformation, and deepfakes.​
- It leverages freely accessible information, making it a cost-effective method for intelligence gathering compared to traditional, classified intelligence sources.​
- OSINT techniques can detect false information and misleading content by cross-referencing data across multiple sources.​
- It helps verify the authenticity of digital content, such as images and videos, by analyzing metadata, source credibility, and content patterns.​
- OSINT tools can provide real-time alerts and monitoring, crucial for responding to emerging threats and preventing the spread of misinformation.​

# Deepfake Detection Systems​
- Feature Extraction modules identify key attributes from media files, such as facial features and voice patterns, crucial for distinguishing real from manipulated content.​
- Utilize machine learning techniques, particularly supervised learning, to analyze features and classify content as real or fake.​
- Some systems, such as a hybrid CNN-LSTM, leverage both convolutional and recurrent neural networks for improved detection capabilities through transfer learning.​
- The system integrates outputs from various classifiers to ensure high accuracy in detecting deepfakes, making it an invaluable tool for preserving digital content integrity.​
